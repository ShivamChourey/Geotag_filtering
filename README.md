# Geotag_filtering
This file reads all the '.JPG' files in a folder and reads their geotags. 
If the latitude and longitude of the image geotags are within a defined range then the file is copied to a subfolder 
"filtered" created in the current directory. The code can support Windows as well as Linux by commenting and uncommenting a single line.
A comment can be found on the relevant line.
